<h2 id="what-is-pwa">What is PWA <a class="direct-link" href="#what-is-pwa">#</a></h2>
<p>A quick Google search will tell you a PWA is a website or web application that can be installed on your system. And I'll tell you it's simply a website with the behavior of a native app. Once installed, it's hard to tell the difference between it and a real app.</p>
<p>PWA allows cross-platform delivery of the a web app without the need of an app-store. Under the hood, they are simply web pages but on the surface they look and feel like an app. How amazing, huh?<br>
And by cross-platform I mean both mobile and desktop devices</p>
<h3 id="pwa-features">PWA Features <a class="direct-link" href="#pwa-features">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>App-like user interface<br>
Mobile users have grown accustomed to native app experience when using their mobile devices. And pwa gives them exactly that.</li>
<li>Offline support<br>
With the use of service workers API, pwa can be made to work without an internet connection.<br>
During the initial visit to your website, the site's content is saved on the visitors' device to be used in the event of no connection. This makes your website blazing fast with or without internet.</li>
<li>Responsive<br>
PWA's adjust to different kind of devices ranging from mobile, tablets to desktops.<br>
No one device is left handicapped when it comes to delivering great user experience.</li>
<li>Compatible with many browsers<br>
As I mentioned to you before, pwa uses a web browser engine in the background to render your web content. It goes without saying it greatly depends on your browser.<br>
Good news is that it is supported across major web browsers such as Google Chrome, Firefox and Safari.<br>
Who doesn't use a web browser? Therefore it has a wide reach to users and potential customers.</li>
<li>Easy installation<br>
Convincing someone to install anything is not an easy job. This is simplified in the pwa world as anyone visiting your website can be prompted by their web browser to add your website to their home screen. When they agree, that's it.<br>
You don't have to put your app in the app-stores and allocate a budget for advertising it.<br>
People love shortcuts on their devices and they will most probably agree to add your web app to their home screens</li>
<li>Self-updating<br>
How often do you update your apps?? If at all you do updates, do you do it soon after an update is availble?<br>
If you are like most people, you probably don't update your apps often and you don't do it soon enough.<br>
But with pwa, you don't have to update anything as pwa user and you don't have to publish any update anywhere as pwa owner. Just make any change in your website and it will reflect on your pwa as soon as your users are connected to the internet.</li>
<li>Push notification<br>
The pwa on your users devices is able to send real-time alerts and push notifications just like native apps like Whatsapp do even when the pwa isn't running.<br>
This increase customers engagemnent and a business can use this to it's advatage.</li>
<li>Perfomant<br>
PWAs use less data, storage space, processing power than native apps. This does't slow them down, instead they load content faster. Sometimes event faster than native applications</li>
<li>Secure<br>
HTTPS is the only protocol allowed for pwa. This is the highest level of security availble on the internet.</li>
<li>SEO-frindly<br>
PWAs are simply web pages under the surface. Making them searchable on the internet and showing up on the serch results just like regular websites. This can't be done with native apps.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="pwa-advantages-for-a-business">PWA Advantages for a business <a class="direct-link" href="#pwa-advantages-for-a-business">#</a></h2>
<p>Here are the ways it might be beneficial to your business.</p>
<h3 id="affordable-alternative-to-native-apps">Affordable alternative to native apps <a class="direct-link" href="#affordable-alternative-to-native-apps">#</a></h3>
<p>Both pwa and native apps deliver great customer experince but their cost of development and maintainance differ so much as you see;<br>
PWAs:</p>
<h3 id="shorter-development-time">Shorter development time <a class="direct-link" href="#shorter-development-time">#</a></h3>
<p>Spinning up a simple website and publishing it on the internet is a walk in the park if you compare it to coding a native app for android or IOS.</p>
<h3 id="organic-traffic">Organic traffic <a class="direct-link" href="#organic-traffic">#</a></h3>
<p>Organic traffic are visitors that come from search engines to your website after searching a term relevant to your business. Because a pwa is a website, it get the visitors with little effort. For a native app the only way to get traffic is if a user opens your app.</p>
<h3 id="smaller-bugdet">Smaller bugdet <a class="direct-link" href="#smaller-bugdet">#</a></h3>
<p>They take less time to develop, little effort to maintain and minimal to zero advertisemnt bugdet. PWAs are truly budget friendly.</p>
<h3 id="increase-in-content-consumption">Increase in content consumption <a class="direct-link" href="#increase-in-content-consumption">#</a></h3>
<p>In order to convert your web visitors into a customer, the visitors have to know about you and your products. You give them this information through your content in form articles for example. With pwa's offline capabilities, content is always readily available regardless of intenet connection.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion <a class="direct-link" href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>Instead of businesses building new mobile apps, they are moving to a much simpler and effective solution. PWAs.<br>
PWA's make the buying and selling process simpler and more accessible for businesses and customers.<br>
Companies that use pwa don't need to adjust their apps to support Android, IOS or any other operating system. Instead they just need to utitileze the web technlogy to provide an app-like experience to their customers.<br>
It is cheaper, faster than native counterparts and can also work offline.<br>
Your business should not only have a PWA, it needs one. It's benefits are so great to miss. Don't be left behind</p>
