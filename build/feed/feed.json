      "content_html": "<p>Dark mode and offline web development patterns have been on the rise lately. But why?<br />\nI will give one simple answer. Accessibility.<br />\nIf you want to satistfy your customers of the your top concern should be on how they access your website. If you improve their experience when they are on your website they will be happier. Happy customers keep coming back and this means more profit for your business.</p>\n<p>You might wonder what dark mode and offline has to with making customers happier.<br />\nNot everyone uses their phone under bright enviroment. And internet is expensive in some countries so some of your customers might save your website for offline viewing later on. I hope you get the point.<br />\nLet's get started with adding this offline dark mode to your website.offline</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-use-localstorage%3F\">Why use localStorage? <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://ronaldlat.github.io/posts/how-to-build-offline-darkmode-on-your-website/#why-use-localstorage%3F\">#</a></h3>\n<p>LocalStorage is simply a database that resides inside the web browser. It allows us to store and retrieve data on the clients machine for later use even without internet connection.<br />\nWe could have used cookies or caches to store the state of users preference (dark or light mode) but we will go with localStorage.<br />\nLocalStorage is prefered because it has several advantages over the other storage options in this use case.</p>\n<h3 id=\"advantages-of-localstorage\">Advantages of localStorage <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://ronaldlat.github.io/posts/how-to-build-offline-darkmode-on-your-website/#advantages-of-localstorage\">#</a></h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Free database that come with all browsers. No installation or hosting fee headaches.</li>\n<li>No expiration. Data remains in the database as long as the browser lives, unless manually deleted.</li>\n<li>A whooping 5mb space. That is more than enough for most projects.</li>\n<li>Easy to use key-value pair system. It's easy as it sounds.</li>\n<li>Client-based. No server overload or database queries. Everything works on the client's machine.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"make-a-simple-website\">Make A Simple Website <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://ronaldlat.github.io/posts/how-to-build-offline-darkmode-on-your-website/#make-a-simple-website\">#</a></h3>\n<p>We will need a website to add the dark mode to. So let's get started with it.</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;\n   &lt;head&gt;\n     &lt;meta charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;&gt;\n     &lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0&quot;&gt;\n     &lt;title&gt;Document&lt;/title&gt;\n     &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;style.css&quot;&gt;\n   &lt;/head&gt;\n   &lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;main&gt;\n      &lt;button&gt;darkMode Toggle&lt;/button&gt;\n      &lt;h1 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;welcome to dark mode&lt;/h1&gt;\n    &lt;/main&gt;\n   &lt;/body&gt;\n  &lt;/html&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>There is nothing special here. Just a simple site with button and heading elements wrapped inside a main tag.</p>\n<h3 id=\"create-and-link-css-file\">Create and link CSS file <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://ronaldlat.github.io/posts/how-to-build-offline-darkmode-on-your-website/#create-and-link-css-file\">#</a></h3>\n<p>We will use css for styling and javascript for adding functionality.</p>\n<pre><code>body {\n  max-width: 100%;\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 100vh;\n}\nmain {\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 100%;\n  display: flex;\n  align-items: center;\n  justify-content: center;\n}\nh1 {\n  text-transform: uppercase;\n}\n\nbutton {\n  position: absolute;\n  top: 10px;\n  right: 10px;\n}\n.darkMode {\n  background-color: black;\n  color: white;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Most of the styling rules are self-explanatory. The most import rules are in the <code>.darkMode</code> class.<br />\nIn this class you will define how you want the dark mode version of your website to look. You will definetly make things more darker and in this case our background color is set to black and text is set to white. You can use any colors you prefer.</p>\n<pre><code> .darkMode {\n    background-color: black;\n    color: white;\n  }\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"create-and-link-javascript-file\">Create and link Javascript file <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://ronaldlat.github.io/posts/how-to-build-offline-darkmode-on-your-website/#create-and-link-javascript-file\">#</a></h3>\n<p>In javascript is where all the magic happens. On a click of a button the entire background of the website will be changed by applying the <code>.darkMode</code> class.<br />\nThe chosen preference will also be saved on the users browser on a database called localStorage.<br />\nWe will begin by defining a few variables.</p>\n<pre><code>let darkMode = localStorage.getItem('darkMode')\n</code></pre>\n<p>Instantiate the name of the variable will use to save user's selection in the localStorage.</p>\n<pre><code>let darkModeButton = document.querySelector('button')\n</code></pre>\n<p>Next we grab the button and store it in a variable so that we can easily refer to it.<br />\nI am using the <code>button</code> tag to grab it because it is the only button in the page. If you have more than one button use a class or id to refer to it.</p>\n<p>The page will initially load on a light theme. But if the user had visited before and changed to dark mode we need to make it load on that setting. This 'if' statement will help us achieve that.</p>\n<pre><code>if (darkMode == 'enabled'){\n  enableDarkMode();\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This statement will check the localStorage and read <code>darkMode</code>'s variable value. If it reads <code>'enabled'</code> it will call the function <code>enableDarkMode()</code> which will enable dark mode. Don't worry about the function as we will define it in the next line.</p>\n<pre><code>function enableDarkMode() {\n  document.querySelector(&quot;main&quot;).classList.add(&quot;darkMode&quot;);\n  localStorage.setItem(&quot;darkMode&quot;, &quot;enabled&quot;);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The first line of this function will grab the body element and add the css class <code>'.darkMode'</code> which simply applies the rules defined in the css file.</p>\n<p>The second line will update the value of <code>darkMode</code> to <code>'enabled'</code> in the localStorage. So that the chosen mode stays in memory in page reload or in case of internet loss.</p>\n<pre><code>function disableDarkMode() {\n  document.querySelector(&quot;main&quot;).classList.remove(&quot;darkMode&quot;);\n  localStorage.setItem(&quot;darkMode&quot;, null);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>A function of disabling the dark mode is required in case the user wants a light theme later on. The above function does exactly that.<br />\nIt achieves this by doing the direct opposite of what <code>enableDarkMode()</code> function does.<br />\nThe first line grabs the body element and removes the '.darkMode' class which is responsible for applying the dark mode.<br />\nThe second line updates the localStorage and changes the value of <code>darkMode</code> to <code>null</code>. You can think of <code>null</code> is <code>disabled</code>, you might even use it if you prefer it.</p>\n<p>All the variables and functions been defined. But how do will apply them?<br />\nThat is where the button comes in. A user will click a button to toggle between the modes. On every click a function will be called which will implement the requested changes. An event listenter which will be listening for the 'click' event will be added to the button.</p>\n<pre><code>toggleButton.addEventListener(&quot;click&quot;, () =&gt; {\n  darkMode = localStorage.getItem(&quot;darkMode&quot;);\n\n  if (darkMode !== &quot;enabled&quot;) {\n    enableDarkMode();\n  } else {\n    disableDarkMode();\n  }\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>When the button is clicked, the value of <code>darkMode</code> will be read from the localStorage.<br />\nThis value is what is going to determine which function is going to be called.<br />\nThe 'if' statement states that if the value of <code>darkMode</code> is not <code>enabled</code>, the <code>enableDarkMode()</code> function will be called which in return will set the page to dark mode. Otherwise it will call the <code>disableDarkMode()</code> function will result to the page being set to the default them.<br />\nAnd that is how you enable dark to your website which works offline.</p>\n<h3 id=\"full-code\">Full code <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://ronaldlat.github.io/posts/how-to-build-offline-darkmode-on-your-website/#full-code\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Here are all the codes used in this project.</p>\n<h4 id=\"html\">HTML <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://ronaldlat.github.io/posts/how-to-build-offline-darkmode-on-your-website/#html\">#</a></h4>\n<pre><code>&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;meta charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;Document&lt;/title&gt;\n    &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;style.css&quot; /&gt;\n  &lt;/head&gt;\n  &lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;main&gt;\n      &lt;button&gt;darkMode Toggle&lt;/button&gt;\n      &lt;h1 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;welcome to dark mode&lt;/h1&gt;\n    &lt;/main&gt;\n\n    &lt;script src=&quot;app.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n  &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\n</code></pre>\n<h4 id=\"css\">CSS <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://ronaldlat.github.io/posts/how-to-build-offline-darkmode-on-your-website/#css\">#</a></h4>\n<pre><code>body {\n  max-width: 100%;\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 100vh;\n}\nmain {\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 100%;\n  display: flex;\n  align-items: center;\n  justify-content: center;\n}\nh1 {\n  text-transform: uppercase;\n}\n\nbutton {\n  position: absolute;\n  top: 10px;\n  right: 10px;\n}\n.darkMode {\n  background-color: black;\n  color: white;\n}\n\n</code></pre>\n<h4 id=\"javascript\">Javascript <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://ronaldlat.github.io/posts/how-to-build-offline-darkmode-on-your-website/#javascript\">#</a></h4>\n<pre><code>let darkMode = localStorage.getItem(&quot;darkMode&quot;);\nlet toggleButton = document.querySelector(&quot;button&quot;);\n\nif (darkMode == &quot;enabled&quot;) {\n  enableDarkMode();\n}\n\nfunction enableDarkMode() {\n  document.querySelector(&quot;main&quot;).classList.add(&quot;darkMode&quot;);\n  localStorage.setItem(&quot;darkMode&quot;, &quot;enabled&quot;);\n}\n\nfunction disableDarkMode() {\n  document.querySelector(&quot;main&quot;).classList.remove(&quot;darkMode&quot;);\n  localStorage.setItem(&quot;darkMode&quot;, null);\n}\n\ntoggleButton.addEventListener(&quot;click&quot;, () =&gt; {\n  darkMode = localStorage.getItem(&quot;darkMode&quot;);\n\n  if (darkMode !== &quot;enabled&quot;) {\n    enableDarkMode();\n  } else {\n    disableDarkMode();\n  }\n});\n\n</code></pre>\n",

      "content_html": "<p>The Domain Name System is like the phone book of the internet.<br />\nHuman readable URLs or domain names like <code>www.google.com</code> are like home addresses. This URLs are mapped to IP addresses such as <code>172.16.254.3 </code> which are locations of servers which host the website.</p>\n<p>A server in simple terms is just a computer which is connected to the internet and has the files of a website. When you visit a website, the DNS maps the URL to the IP addresses of the computer that that hosts the website.</p>\n<p>It queries the local machine first for address. If the local machine is empty it then queries a special kind of server called Recursive Resolver. It is recursive because it makes multiple requests to other servers. You can think of it as giving out different phonebooks to a classroom of students and asking them to search for a specic person's phone number. The students in this example are like other servers. They will do this at the same time and one of them will be able to find it. That is how Recursive Resolver works in a nutshell.</p>\n<p>The other servers that Recursive Resolver queries are called TLD servers or Top Level Domain servers. They store data of top level domains such as .com, .net or .io. The Resolver gets a response of the authoritative name server's IP address which is the server of the requsted website.<br />\nThis is sent back to the client and is cached for future use. All this happens happens in seconds despite sounding very complicated.happens</p>\n<p>When you buy a domain name from companies such as BlueHost or TrueHost, it is handled by a Registrar. The record is then maintained by a Registry who stores your DNS settings and distributes them to other DNS servers around the world.</p>\n<p>After acquiring a domain name you will be asssigned a Zone File which you can use to configue your domain settings. Every Zone has SOA, Start Of Authority Record that tell other dns servers who is in charge of that domain.<br />\nThere is also the 'A' record. It means 'Address' and it maps or matches a domain or sub-domain to IP address of it's host.</p>\n<p>In other cases we may want to redirect a domain to another domain on the internet instead of an IP address. In such case a CNAME or Canonical Name will be used to serve this purpose.<br />\nFinally we have the NS or Name Server record. This is URL the internet can ping to find an IP address.<br />\nDNS is import to understand because when you plan on having a website you will need to acquire a domain name and using DNS is unavoidable. Unless you will relegate this task to a Web developer, it is fundamental to understand what DNS is and how it works.<br />\nThis has been a brief overview of what Domain Name System or DNS is.</p>\n",

More than <strong>50%</strong> of internet traffic come from mobile devices. No more developing websites that are only viewable on desktop only. Your websites should approach mobile-first design meaning it should be first usable on mobile before you even think of something else.</p>\n<p>Otherwise you are literally saying no half on the internet traffic and that's half of the prospects that could be looking forward to doing business with you.<br />\nThat's a huge chunk of potential revenue that you shouldn't be missing out on.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2.-use-high-quality-professional-images\">2.

Increase Your Online Presence <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://ronaldlat.github.io/posts/12-benefits-of-a-website-for-a-small-business/#1.-increase-your-online-presence\">#</a></h3>\n<p>You are online right now aren't you? Your potential customers or clients probably are too. It is therefore wise to reach out to your potential buyers or clients where they are.</p>\n<p>A recent study in January 2021 shows that <strong>4.67 billion</strong> people which is <strong>59.5% of the global population</strong> are active internet users. And <strong>92.6% (4.32 billion) are mobile users</strong>. Just think of the difference a fraction of this traffic can do to your business. It is life changing of course.</p>\n<p>Marketing your products or services to this large audience will increase your sales exponentially. Only if done correctly of course. A shot in the dark will get you undesirable results or no results at all.</p>\n<p>It's up to you if you will take action to claim your share of the goldmine the internet has for you.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2.-get-useful-insight-and-data\">2.

Gathering it in a physical location is quite a challenge as you can imagine. I have a few ideas though:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Analyse CCTV footage of your business - That requires a lot of time and effort which is better used to do more productive tasks</li>\n<li>Ask every new visitor a couple of questions and record in a book or excel sheet - Is that even practical?

And I'll tell you it's simply a website with the behavior of a native app. Once installed, it's hard to tell the difference between it and a real app.</p>\n<p>PWA allows cross-platform delivery of the a web app without the need of an app-store. Under the hood, they are simply web pages but on the surface they look and feel like an app. How amazing, huh?<br />\nAnd by cross-platform I mean both mobile and desktop devices</p>\n<h3 id=\"pwa-features\">PWA Features <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://ronaldlat.github.io/posts/reasons-to-turn-your-website-into-pwa/#pwa-features\">#</a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>App-like user interface<br />\nMobile users have grown accustomed to native app experience when using their mobile devices. And pwa gives them exactly that.</li>\n<li>Offline support<br />\nWith the use of service workers API, pwa can be made to work without an internet connection.<br />\nDuring the initial visit to your website, the site's content is saved on the visitors' device to be used in the event of no connection. This makes your website blazing fast with or without internet.</li>\n<li>Responsive<br />\nPWA's adjust to different kind of devices ranging from mobile, tablets to desktops.<br />\nNo one device is left handicapped when it comes to delivering great user experience.</li>\n<li>Compatible with many browsers<br />\nAs I mentioned to you before, pwa uses a web browser engine in the background to render your web content. It goes without saying it greatly depends on your browser.<br />\nGood news is that it is supported across major web browsers such as Google Chrome, Firefox and Safari.<br />\nWho doesn't use a web browser? Therefore it has a wide reach to users and potential customers.</li>\n<li>Easy installation<br />\nConvincing someone to install anything is not an easy job. This is simplified in the pwa world as anyone visiting your website can be prompted by their web browser to add your website to their home screen. When they agree, that's it.<br />\nYou don't have to put your app in the app-stores and allocate a budget for advertising it.<br />\nPeople love shortcuts on their devices and they will most probably agree to add your web app to their home screens</li>\n<li>Self-updating<br />\nHow often do you update your apps?? If at all you do updates, do you do it soon after an update is availble?<br />\nIf you are like most people, you probably don't update your apps often and you don't do it soon enough.<br />\nBut with pwa, you don't have to update anything as pwa user and you don't have to publish any update anywhere as pwa owner. Just make any change in your website and it will reflect on your pwa as soon as your users are connected to the internet.</li>\n<li>Push notification<br />\nThe pwa on your users devices is able to send real-time alerts and push notifications just like native apps like Whatsapp do even when the pwa isn't running.<br />\nThis increase customers engagemnent and a business can use this to it's advatage.</li>\n<li>Perfomant<br />\nPWAs use less data, storage space, processing power than native apps. This does't slow them down, instead they load content faster. Sometimes event faster than native applications</li>\n<li>Secure<br />\nHTTPS is the only protocol allowed for pwa. This is the highest level of security availble on the internet.</li>\n<li>SEO-frindly<br />\nPWAs are simply web pages under the surface. Making them searchable on the internet and showing up on the serch results just like regular websites. This can't be done with native apps.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"pwa-advantages-for-a-business\">PWA Advantages for a business <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://ronaldlat.github.io/posts/reasons-to-turn-your-website-into-pwa/#pwa-advantages-for-a-business\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Here are the ways it might be beneficial to your business.</p>\n<h3 id=\"affordable-alternative-to-native-apps\">Affordable alternative to native apps <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://ronaldlat.github.io/posts/reasons-to-turn-your-website-into-pwa/#affordable-alternative-to-native-apps\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Both pwa and native apps deliver great customer experince but their cost of development and maintainance differ so much as you see;<br />\nPWAs:</p>\n<h3 id=\"shorter-development-time\">Shorter development time <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://ronaldlat.github.io/posts/reasons-to-turn-your-website-into-pwa/#shorter-development-time\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Spinning up a simple website and publishing it on the internet is a walk in the park if you compare it to coding a native app for android or IOS.</p>\n<h3 id=\"organic-traffic\">Organic traffic <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://ronaldlat.github.io/posts/reasons-to-turn-your-website-into-pwa/#organic-traffic\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Organic traffic are visitors that come from search engines to your website after searching a term relevant to your business.
