## What is PWA

A quick Google search will tell you a PWA is a website or web application that can be installed on your system. And I'll tell you it's simply a website with the behavior of a native app. Once installed, it's hard to tell the difference between it and a real app.

PWA allows cross-platform delivery of the a web app without the need of an app-store. Under the hood, they are simply web pages but on the surface they look and feel like an app. How amazing, huh?
And by cross-platform I mean both mobile and desktop devices

### PWA Features

- App-like user interface
  Mobile users have grown accustomed to native app experience when using their mobile devices. And pwa gives them exactly that.
- Offline support
  With the use of service workers API, pwa can be made to work without an internet connection.
  During the initial visit to your website, the site's content is saved on the visitors' device to be used in the event of no connection. This makes your website blazing fast with or without internet.
- Responsive
  PWA's adjust to different kind of devices ranging from mobile, tablets to desktops.
  No one device is left handicapped when it comes to delivering great user experience.
- Compatible with many browsers
  As I mentioned to you before, pwa uses a web browser engine in the background to render your web content. It goes without saying it greatly depends on your browser.
  Good news is that it is supported across major web browsers such as Google Chrome, Firefox and Safari.
  Who doesn't use a web browser? Therefore it has a wide reach to users and potential customers.
- Easy installation
  Convincing someone to install anything is not an easy job. This is simplified in the pwa world as anyone visiting your website can be prompted by their web browser to add your website to their home screen. When they agree, that's it.
  You don't have to put your app in the app-stores and allocate a budget for advertising it.
  People love shortcuts on their devices and they will most probably agree to add your web app to their home screens
- Self-updating
  How often do you update your apps?? If at all you do updates, do you do it soon after an update is availble?
  If you are like most people, you probably don't update your apps often and you don't do it soon enough.
  But with pwa, you don't have to update anything as pwa user and you don't have to publish any update anywhere as pwa owner. Just make any change in your website and it will reflect on your pwa as soon as your users are connected to the internet.
- Push notification
  The pwa on your users devices is able to send real-time alerts and push notifications just like native apps like Whatsapp do even when the pwa isn't running.
  This increase customers engagemnent and a business can use this to it's advatage.
- Perfomant
  PWAs use less data, storage space, processing power than native apps. This does't slow them down, instead they load content faster. Sometimes event faster than native applications
- Secure
  HTTPS is the only protocol allowed for pwa. This is the highest level of security availble on the internet.
- SEO-frindly
  PWAs are simply web pages under the surface. Making them searchable on the internet and showing up on the serch results just like regular websites. This can't be done with native apps.

## PWA Advantages for a business

Here are the ways it might be beneficial to your business.

### Affordable alternative to native apps

Both pwa and native apps deliver great customer experince but their cost of development and maintainance differ so much as you see;
PWAs:

### Shorter development time

Spinning up a simple website and publishing it on the internet is a walk in the park if you compare it to coding a native app for android or IOS.

### Organic traffic

Organic traffic are visitors that come from search engines to your website after searching a term relevant to your business. Because a pwa is a website, it get the visitors with little effort. For a native app the only way to get traffic is if a user opens your app.

### Smaller bugdet

They take less time to develop, little effort to maintain and minimal to zero advertisemnt bugdet. PWAs are truly budget friendly.

### Increase in content consumption

In order to convert your web visitors into a customer, the visitors have to know about you and your products. You give them this information through your content in form articles for example. With pwa's offline capabilities, content is always readily available regardless of intenet connection.
