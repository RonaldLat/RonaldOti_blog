# What makes an Interior Design Website Great?

Not all websites are created equally. Some are great, some not so great. In this article you are going to learn how to create or acquire a great website for for your Interior Design firm.

If I ware to tell you what is great interior design website in twenty seconds I'd tell you that it's main objective should be to inform a visitor of all matters related to interior design.  
But we do have more than 20 seconds so let's dig a little deeper.

<!-- A great interior design website should have the following: -->

### 1 Adaptive to all types of devices

It is the year 2021 for Christ's sake. More than **50%** of internet traffic come from mobile devices. No more developing websites that are only viewable on desktop only. Your websites should approach mobile-first design meaning it should be first usable on mobile before you even think of something else. 
 
Otherwise you are literally saying no half on the internet traffic and that's half of the prospects that could be looking forward to doing business with you.
That's a huge chunk of potential revenue that you shouldn't be missing out on.

### 2. Use high-quality professional images

A picture speaks a thousand words and in interior design it speaks everything about your business. Great photos will capture your visitors attention and that will result to them staying on your website longer enabling them to learn more about about your business and the value you can provide to them. 

Display your best work in the best way possible and this will enthuse your visitors and they will be eager to book your services. You can't afford not to have great photos on your website. Invest in a professional photographer's services if you have to.

### 3. Fast loading

You should know that your website conversion rates drop up to 20% per second of site's load time. People have become accustomed to fast everything, fast food, fast cars, fast internet, fast dating ...oops speed dating. With the lack of patience these days people will not entertain a slow website. They will simply click the competitors link and you will be missing out on a huge piece of potential clients. Hire a professional web developer who will make your website jet-fast and blow the competition out of the water.

### 4. Has a call to action

You have a nice website which is fast, has great content, is adaptive to all devices, and has even great images. So what?

Your visitors have visited your website and they have experienced all that. Now what is it that your require them to do next? This is where Call To Action (CTA) comes into play. You might think that it is obvious what a visitor should do after visiting your website but you're very wrong. 

You see all those 'Like', 'Subscribe', 'Join our newsletter' etc. everywhere every time. Why? Because they work. People always need that extra guidance on what step to take next and you should be providing it if you want to stay in business.

Tell you visitors what desirable action you would like them to take next that will bring value to you your business. 

For example ask them to drop their email so that you can send them your latest design trends that no one else has seen. 
You could later use this emails in your email marketing campaigns.

### 5. Regularly Updated.

To wrap things up your website should be regularly to keep visitors coming back for more. What would do you do when you land on a page that was last updated 3 years ago? You will go trust the information? Will you go ahead and do business with the firm?  

If your answers are 'no' then you shouldn't be doing this mistake. 
A website which isn't regularly updated shows lack of commitment from the business and no one wants to work with a interior designer who isn't committed to his craft. You will simply miss out on a ton of business opportunities.

#### Final words
A website is not useful to your business if it isn't serving it's intended purpose.  
If you have any questions, need a website for your firm or you need help to get your current website to get you the results you desire, don't hesitate to contact me.

End.
