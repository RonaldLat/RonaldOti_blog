### Facebook Groups

Groups in Facebook are just a community of people with similar interests confined in a similar place. 
Send as many requests as you can to join groups that are relevant to what your write about. 
Start interacting with other members by asking and/or answering questions. 
Don't spam the groups with your blog links everywhere. Make sure your provide value and when you post a link to your blog post, it offers a solution to other members pain points. Or at least it answers their questions.

You can also send friend requests to other members and later on ask them to join your own group. Continue offering them value even in your own group to keep them members and help the group grow. 

### Post the ideal amount of times a day

Keep it minimal to give your Facebook feed room to breathe and your audience time to digest your content. 
**Sharing 1-2 link posts every day** will get you better results.
