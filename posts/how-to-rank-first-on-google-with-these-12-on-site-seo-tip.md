Learning how to rank first on Google with on-page or on-site strategies is not that difficult but a very effective.
With this tips, you don't have to use any tools or do any research to implement them. You just need to fine tune a few things and optimimze this and that. In return you will be rewarded with a steady stream of free and unlimited visitors to your website. More visitors means more customers and more profits for your business. Without further ado here are the tips.

### Make your website resposive

Responsive websites resize dynmacally according to the width of the user's device. One does not need to pinch to zoom in order to view your content. Stuff just fit accordingly in regard to the screen size. A simple rule is to always develop for mobile devices first before developing for desktop. 

Mobile-first development is very important because ***60%*** of searches are carried out using mobile devices. That is quite a huge chunk of potential traffic to miss out on. 
Google search engine will thank you by ranking you top on the search results and thus sending more visitors your way.

### Fast loading website

Not everyone has a 4G of 5G internet. If your website has large images, sends too many HTTP request or files are not compressed, it will struggle to load fast. People are not patient these days. If your sites takes a little longer to load the visitor will simply leave and click on the competitors link.

Resize and reduce your image sizes so that they don't slow down your website. 
Lower the number of HTTP requests your website has to make to fetch resouces or load libraries. You can opt to bundle your code to form a single code bundle that can be served at once by using build toos such as <a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/"> Snowpack</a>. I vouch for Snowpack because it is fast and requires very little configuration. But you are free to use any other build tool. 

You can also cache resouces to clients devices so that they don't have to download the same things again if they make a return visit. This will make your website faster for them as they will be downloading fewer items. 
This can be accomplished by the help of `web workers` which work in ***Progressive Web Apps*** You can check out <a href=""> the benefits of turning your website into PWA </a> in this article.

### Link internally

Internal linking or Inbound linking is very important in keeping visitors in your website for longer. A visitor will find more content to consume by finding links of other resources distributed throught the website and this will in return reduce bounce rate. 

Bounce rate is when a visitor visits only  a single page on your website and then leaves entirely. These signals to Google that your website is not content rich and thus people are not happy with it. It will be therefore shown further from the top of search results. 

But if you distribute your links link well, it will give visitors fodder to chew on for longer and Google will recommend you even more on top of search results. 
Google search engine has robots that crawl your website to determine if you link internally. If you have, you will be rewarded with a spot in the top of search. 

### Link externally

The opposite of internal linking is... You guessed right. External linking or Outbound linking. 
This is basically doing what we have done about internal linking, linking to relevant external resources. It is important you link to articles or resources relevant to what is in your website from websites that are of hight quility content and have authority.

When you link externally, it tells Google that your articles are valid, informative and can therefore be trusted. 

### Optimize all your images

This is not an easy task if your website has a lot of images that were not optimized before. Large image sizes and dimension can a good website the worst. 
It will take long to load and even longer on poor internet. Components will shift positions just as when the visitor is starting to read something because the images will be loading late and trying to adjust themselves. This will annoy users who will definately leave your website and never come back again. 

Google crawlers will also notice the heavy images on your website and will refuse to rank you on top. Google's top priority is to provide users with the best possible content and user experience. 
A website that takes almost 30 seconds to load and eats up all of the visitor's data doesn't sound like a great user experience to me. How about you?

### Host at a better platform

Where your website lives or where you host it greatly impacts the speed at which it loads. 
Majority of old website are still hosted on ***Dedicated Servers*** or ***Shared Hosting*** platforms. I'm not saying this is bad. It isn't ideal today. 

You should be be hosting on ***CDN*** or Content Delivery Networks which is also hosting on the Cloud. 
The advantage of CDN is that Cloud computing is distributed geographically around the world and your website is living in those all locations too. So when visitors visit your site they served with the resources closest to them, your site lightening fast.  
The same cannot be said about Dedicated Servers hosting where your site files are confined to a single geographic location. 

Ideally your website should take ***5 seconds*** to load. According to <a href="https://www.semrush.com/blog/how-fast-is-fast-enough-page-load-time-and-your-bottom-line/"> this Semrush's article</a>:
- If your website loads in ***5 seconds*** , its is faster than roughly ***25%*** of other websites.
- If your website loads in ***2.5 seconds*** , its is faster than roughly ***50%*** of other websites.
- If your website loads in ***1.7 seconds*** , its is faster than roughly ***75%*** of other websites.
- If your website loads in ***0.8 seconds*** , its is faster than roughly ***94%*** of other websites.

These are estimates for a 5Mb site size and as you can see, you should be aiming at 5 second site load speed at worst.
